This project uses an arduino UNO to move the ocular in a galilean telescope to focus an image.

The folder "codigo-motor" has the code necessary to make the motor move and comunicate with a python program that can run in any computer using the libraries listed in "requirements.txt".

The final results are ilustrated in "Telescopio_de_autoenfoque.pdf", where we added a couple of figures comparing the image seen through the telescope before and after running the program, along with the circuit and other necesary components.
